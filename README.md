## The repository for my 1st assignment in CS 333, Intro to Operating Systems

This assignment had us writing our own versions of a memory allocation library.
Following a "first fit" algorithm, we wrote our own versions of:
- malloc -> vikalloc
- free -> vikfree
- calloc -> vikcalloc
- realloc -> vikrealloc
- strdup -> vikstrdup

My work is all in vikalloc.c within the functions listed above.
The other files were written by our professor to help set up and manage the data structure, as well as give us a way to easily test our code.
